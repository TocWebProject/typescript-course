*** Notes about TypeScript ***

Ts is an extension to Js. Most popular static type extension for Js.
-> Ts adding some safety stuff for big project
-> We see error when transpiling and not in the runtime
-> With Ts we can have Data Types, helps us to work with entitites, ex: entity: user with properties.
-> Ts cant be run into browsers directly, need to be transpiled into Js
-> We carn run JS and Ts simultaneously in the same project
-> Ts helps to write code betters -- Plan for the app a real architectur and data types


Ex with class Person

JAVASCRIPT

class Person {
    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }

    getFullName() {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName
    }
}

const person = new Person("Monster, "lessons")

TypeScript

class Person {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;

    constructor(firstName: string, lastName: string) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }

    getFullName(): string {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName
    }
}

const person = new Person("Monster, "lessons")



*** SETTING UP ***

-> Need node 
-> Install TypeScript Globaly / tsc -v

to transpile some file: we run command line tsc main.ts to create main.js
TypeScript transpiles by default to ES3

Use the -w watch mode to compile at each changes: tsc main.ts -w



*** CONFIG tscong.json ***

Configure compilerOptions: rootDir & outDir
Then just "tsc -w" in the terminal and no more "tsc main.ts -w"



*** VARIABLES ***

Const are real Const. asigning a type.

-> this can not working:
const hello = "world";
hello = "foo"

To change a propertie we need to use "let" of course !

let hello = "world";
hello = "foo";

WARNING: WE CAN CHANGE VALUE ONLY TO THE SAME TYPE. 
-> the type stay consistant

its also better to always specify types explicitly in definition

We using let & const in Ts but TypeScript transpiles everything in JS ES3
so "let" in main.ts hello: string = "world"; will be var hello = "world"; in main.js



*** FUNCTIONS ***

Its safer to define everything explicitly !
